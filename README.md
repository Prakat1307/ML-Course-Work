ML Housing Analysis - Course Work
This project implements a complete machine learning pipeline for housing price prediction and classification using Python. It includes data exploration, statistical analysis, linear regression models (Linear, Ridge, Lasso), and classification algorithms (Bayesian Logistic Regression, SVM). The project contains 4 comprehensive Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate end-to-end ML workflow from data loading to model evaluation. Built with pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib for a BTech Computer Science AI/ML course. Results show Ridge Regression and SVM as top performers with comprehensive cross-validation metrics.
